= WildFly Quickstarts

[toc]

[abstract]
The quickstarts demonstrate Java EE 8 and a few additional technologies from the WildFly stack. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.



[[introduction]]
== Introduction

These quickstarts run on the WildFly application server. The quickstarts are configured to use the correct Maven dependencies and ensure that you test and compile the quickstarts against the correct runtime environment.

Each quickstart folder contains a `README.adoc` file that describes the quickstart features and provides instructions about how to build and run it. Instructions are provided to build the more readable `README.html` files.

Make sure you read this entire document before you attempt to work with the quickstarts.

[[use_of_product_home_and_jboss_home_variables]]
== Use of WILDFLY_HOME and QUICKSTART_HOME Variables

The quickstart `README` files use the _replaceable_ value `__WILDFLY_HOME__` to denote the path to the WildFly server. When you encounter this value in a `README` file, make sure you replace it with the actual path to your WildFly server.

When you see the replaceable variable __QUICKSTART_HOME__, replace it with the path to the root directory of all of the quickstarts.

[[system_requirements]]
== System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on WildFly 16 or later.

All you need to build these projects is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must perform the following tasks.

. xref:build_wildfly_server_and_boms[Build the WildFly server and BOMs]: Fetch the latest WildFly source code and build the WildFly Server and the WildFly BOMs. This installs the Maven artifacts that are required by the WildFly quickstarts.

. xref:install_the_quickstart_parent_artifact_in_maven[Install the Quickstart Parent Artifact in Maven]: The root `POM.xml` file defines dependencies that are required by some of the quickstarts.

. xref:build_quickstart_readme_files[Build the Quickstart README.html Files]: The quickstart `README` files are written in AsciiDoc to provide modular, reusable content; however, this makes them difficult to read. For this reason, you also must build the quickstart `README.html` files from the AsciiDoc source.

[[build_wildfly_server_and_boms]]
=== Build the WildFly Server and BOMs

You must build the WildFly server and BOMs to install the Maven artifacts before you can build a quickstart or a quickstart's `README.html` file. The WildFly development team normally takes care of building and publishing the Maven artifacts needed to build the quickstarts in this repository, but as with all new development, there might be times where you need a library that has not yet been updated. Occasionally you might also need an update that was made to WildFly core.

The order for building the WildFly server is as follows.

. xref:build_wildfly_core[Build WildFly core] (if required)
. xref:build_wildfly_server[Build the Wildfly server]
. xref:build_wildfly_boms[Build the Wildfly BOMs]

[discrete]
[[build_wildfly_core]]
==== Build WildFly Core

IMPORTANT: This is only necessary if you need a recent update that was made to WildFly core but it is not yet published.

. If you have not yet done so, you must clone the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core[Wildfly core] repository and navigate to it. You might also want to change the remote name from `origin` to `upstream` to be consistent with your other repositories.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:wildfly/wildfly-core.git
$ cd wildfly-core
$ git remote rename origin upstream
----
. Verify that your local `master` branch contains the latest updates.*
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
----
. Build WildFly core using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

[discrete]
[[build_wildfly_server]]
==== Build the WildFly Server

. If you have not yet done so, you must clone https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly[Wildfly server] repository and navigate to it. You might also want to change the remote name from `origin` to `upstream` to be consistent with your other repositories.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:wildfly/wildfly.git
$ cd wildfly
$ git remote rename origin upstream
----
. Verify that your local `master` branch contains the latest updates.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
----

+
IMPORTANT: If you built the `wildFly-core` repository and need to include those changes, you must set the `version.org.wildfly.core` property in `pom.xml` of this repository to match the version of the `wildfly-core` build.

. Build the WildFly server using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Denforcer.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
----

[discrete]
[[build_wildfly_boms]]
==== Build the WildFly BOMs

. If you have not yet done so, you must clone https://github.com/wildfly/boms[Wildfly boms] repository and navigate to it. You might also want to rename the directory to `wildfly-boms` to make it clear which BOMs it contains. You might also want to change the remote name from `origin` to `upstream` to be consistent with your other repositories.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:wildfly/boms.git
$ mv boms wildfly-boms
$ cd wildfly
$ git remote rename origin upstream
----
. Verify that your local `master` branch contains the latest updates.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
----

. Build the WildFly BOMs using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

NOTE: If you run into build errors, check with the WildFly team to see if the repositories are temporarily out of sync.

. At this point, you can verify that all of the quickstarts build using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install '-Pdefault,!complex-dependencies'
----

[[install_the_quickstart_parent_artifact_in_maven]]
=== Install the Quickstart Parent Artifact in Maven

A few of the quickstarts require the `quickstart-parent` artifact to be installed in your local Maven repository. To install it, navigate to your __QUICKSTART_HOME__ directory  directory and run the following command.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ cd __QUICKSTART_HOME__
$ mvn clean install
----

//******************************************************************************
// We do not have a way of determining whether someone is working with a
// WildFly tagged release or with the currenct quickstart source, so we add
// a note instead.
//******************************************************************************

NOTE: The `quickstart-parent` artifact is already installed to Maven for tagged releases of the quickstarts. If you using a tagged release that you downloaded from the link:https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/[WildFly quickstart repository], you can skip this step.

[[build_quickstart_readme_files]]
=== Build the Quickstart README.html Files

The quickstart `README` files are written in AsciiDoc, not only because the language is much more powerful than Markdown, but also also because it is possible to extract common instructions into separate files to be reused across the quickstarts. While this makes them more flexible and easier to maintain, unfortunately, included files do not render in a readable format in GitHub or in most text editors.

The Maven plugin that is used to build and deploy the quickstarts can also generate fully rendered `README.html` instructions from the `README.adoc` files.

To build all of the quickstart `README.html` files, including the root `README.html` file that contains the table with links to all available quickstarts, navigate to the root folder of the quickstarts and run the same command.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean generate-resources -Pdocs
----

If you see errors about missing dependencies, verify that you xref:build_wildfly_server_and_boms[built the version of the WildFly server and BOMs] that corresponds to the quickstart repository you are using.

[NOTE]
====
To build the `README.html` file for a specific quickstart, navigate to the quickstart directory and run the following command.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean generate-resources -Pdocs

[[suggested_approach_to_the_quickstarts]]
== Suggested Approach to the Quickstarts

We suggest you approach the quickstarts as follows:

* Regardless of your level of expertise, we suggest you start with the `helloworld` quickstart. It is the simplest example and is an easy way to prove the server is configured and running correctly.
* If you are a beginner or new to JBoss, start with the quickstarts labeled `Beginner`, then try those marked as `Intermediate`. When you are comfortable with those, move on to the `Advanced` quickstarts.
* Some quickstarts are based upon other quickstarts but have expanded capabilities and functionality. If a prerequisite quickstart is listed, make sure you deploy and test it before looking at the expanded version.



[[run_the_quickstarts]]
== Run the Quickstarts Using the Maven Command Line

[[build_and_deploy_a_quickstart]]
=== Build and Deploy a Quickstart

The root folder of each individual quickstart contains a `README.html` file with detailed instructions on how to build and run the example. In most cases you do the following:

* Start the WildFly server.
* Build the archive.
* Deploy the quickstart.
* Undeploy the quickstart when you are finished testing.

[[verify_all_quickstarts_build_with_one_command]]
=== Verify All Quickstarts Build with One Command

You can also verify that all of the quickstarts build using one command. However, quickstarts that have complex dependencies must be skipped. For example, the `resteasy-jaxrs-client` quickstart is a RESTEasy client that depends on the deployment of the `helloworld-rs` quickstart. The root `pom.xml` file defines a `complex-dependencies` profile to exclude these quickstarts from the root build process.

To build all of the quickstarts:

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the quickstarts.
. Use the following command to build the quickstarts that do not have complex dependencies:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install '-Pdefault,!complex-dependencies'
----

[[undeploy_all_deployed_quickstarts_with_one_command]]
=== Undeploy All Deployed Quickstarts with One Command

To undeploy all of the the quickstarts from the root of the quickstart folder, you must pass the argument `-fae` (fail at end) on the command line. This allows the command to continue past quickstarts that fail due to complex dependencies or only have Arquillian tests and do not deploy archives to the server.

You can undeploy quickstarts using the following procedure:

. Start the WildFly server.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the quickstarts.
. Use the following command to undeploy any deployed quickstarts.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn wildfly:undeploy -fae
----

To undeploy any quickstarts that fail due to complex dependencies, follow the undeploy procedure described in the quickstart's `README.html` file.

[[run_the_quickstarts_in_jboss_developer_studio_or_eclipse]]
== Run the Quickstarts in Red Hat Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a WildFly server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see link:https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.adoc#use_red_hat_jboss_developer_studio_or_eclipse_to_run_the_quickstarts[Use Red Hat Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts].

[[optional_components]]
== Configure Optional Components

The following components are needed for only a small subset of the quickstarts. Do not install or configure them unless the quickstart requires it.

* xref:create_quickstart_users[Create Quickstart Users]
* xref:configure_postgresql[Configure the PostgreSQL Database]
* xref:configure_byteman[Configure Byteman]

[[create_quickstart_users]]
=== Create Quickstart Users

Some of the quickstarts, particularly those that run in a secured mode and demonstrate security, require that you create quickstart users with different roles for authorization purposes. See link:https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.adoc#create_users_required_by_the_quickstarts[Create Users Required by the Quickstarts] for detailed instructions to create users required by the quickstarts.

[[configure_postgresql]]
=== Configure the PostgreSQL Database

Some of the quickstarts that demonstrate transactions require that you install and configure the PostgreSQL database. See link:https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_POSTGRESQL_JBOSS_EAP.adoc#configure_the_postgresql_database_for_use_with_the_quickstarts[Configure the PostgreSQL Database for Use with the Quickstarts] for instructions.

[[configure_byteman]]
=== Configure Byteman

A few of the quickstarts use _Byteman_ to demonstrate distributed transaction processing and crash recovery. See  link:https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_BYTEMAN.adoc#configure_byteman_for_use_with_the_quickstarts[Configure Byteman for Use with the Quickstarts] for instructions.

[[available_quickstarts]]
== Table of Available Quickstarts

All available quickstarts, which are listed in the following table, can be found here: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/.

Each quickstart provides the list of technologies demonstrated by the quickstart and the required experience level needed to build and deploy it. Click on the quickstart link in the table to see more detailed information about how to run it. Some quickstarts require deployment of other quickstarts. This information is noted in the `Prerequisites` section of the quickstart `README.html` file.

NOTE: Some of these quickstarts use the H2 database included with WildFly. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!
